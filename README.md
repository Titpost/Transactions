1. Controllers' Integration tests are not to be passed without running server. To start Tomcat Server in IntelliJ Idea just press "Shift + F10", or run in via Run/Debug Configuration laucher in IDE's upper right corner.

2. In the file ".idea/workspace.xml" IDEA will find a helpfull configuration to start Tomcat server with one click. Most likely you will not want to track this file with your git. To tell git let this file for your own, type this: 

git update-index --skip-worktree .idea/workspace.xml
