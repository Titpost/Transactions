1. Controllers' Integration tests are not to be passed without running server. To start Tomcat Server in IntelliJ Idea just press "Shift + F10", or run it via Run/Debug Configuration laucher in IDE's upper right corner.

2. The file due to which Idea will find this helpfull configuration to start Tomcat server with one click is ".idea/workspace.xml". Most likely you will not want to track this file with your Git. To tell Git leave this file alone not tracking it, type this in Idea terminal window:

git update-index --skip-worktree .idea/workspace.xml
